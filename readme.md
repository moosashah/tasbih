Project to learn htmx and go 
Plan is to add families so you can see counts / week or something
Add a "chat room" so that you can read together
chat room different from family and anyone with link can join the Room

maybe chatrooms first as the data doesn't need to be presisted and can have arbitary count
setup database connection in case of server crash? delete row once room is closed


## Tasks

- [ ] SQLite connection
- [ ] OAuth?
- [ ] Presist count
- [ ] Create group
- [ ] websocket chat room for counting
